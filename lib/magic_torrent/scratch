piece length = 32768

prev len = 14536192 
file len = 601
post len = 669 + 54 = 723

starting piece = 14536192 / 32768 + 1 = 444
starting byte = 14536192 % 32768 + 1 = 19969

if the file overflows the current piece, then
(starting byte + file len) - piece length = overflow length
overflow length / piece length = overflow pieces
overflow length % piece length = overflow left
read overflow pieces + last piece
on last piece, read from 0 to overflow left

if the file does not overflow the current piece, then
starting byte + file length = end byte
