btclient
========

This is a toy BitTorrent client I've been playing with. I've used BitTorrent alot in the past, and I've never understood
how it worked, so I decided to try making a client in order to learn. 

This repository is a total mess right now, since I've just been testing the protocol. Once I become familiar with the 
protocol, I will organize this into a real rubygem.

TODO:
Finish piece class. Implement downloading by piece and file.
